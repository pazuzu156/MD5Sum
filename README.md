# MD5Sum
MD5Sum is defunct, and is no longer being maintained, so all source code has been taken down.  
The old MD5Sum website is also gone with a permenant redirect to a new URL.

## Checkmate
Checkmate is a fork of MD5Sum in hopes of supporting multiple hash checksums. You can grab the code from the link below, as well as the download site.
