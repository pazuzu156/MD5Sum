This file contains an explanation of the INI file and the macros that are
usable within the INI file for the compiler.

Macros are determined by the system between two hash tags (#)
A standard macro looks like: #AMACRO#

The macros the INI supports are the following:

#CURDIR# 			- Current working directory
#PROGRAMFILES# 		- Points to the Program Files directory of the system
						If you run a 64 bit version and need to point to the
						32 bit Program files directory, use the 32 bit macro
#PROGRAMFILES32# 	- The 32 bit Program Files directory. This is really only
						used for 64 bit users who have applications installed
						within the 32 bit Program Files directory
						
Comments are determined by a # or ; delimiter at the beginning of each line.
Example:

; This is a comment
# This is also a comment
